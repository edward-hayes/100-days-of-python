Can establish heirachy through:
- Color (most obvious): brighter objects draw the eye
- Size: bigger items draw the eye
- Layout: 
    Line Length
    wikipedia is bad design. Very uniform and long lines of text
    Optimal line lenght is 40 to 60 characters per line
    Alignment:
    Having everything aligned looks easier on the eyes
    Key is to reduce the number of alignment points. Even if do nothing else other than alignment the website will look better
    White Space:
    More white space looks more expensive

Design for your audience, think about what would appeal to them
